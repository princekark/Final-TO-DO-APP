 Advanced Todo App Development
 
What did you build, and how did you approach it?
I developed an advanced Todo App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to manage tasks with features like adding, editing, and deleting tasks, alongside persistent local storage. I enhanced the user's experience by including features such as date-specific styling, task completion sounds, color coding for categorization, a stats dashboard, and animations on task completion. My strategy was to break down this project into phases: just setting up the basic framework, then CRUD functionality, followed by the integration of the advanced features.

What challenges were there, and how did you overcome them?
One of the biggest problems was the implementation of date-specific styling. I overcame that by comparing due dates with the current date in JavaScript and used dynamic CSS classes. The inclusion of the completion sound needed some idea about how the <audio> tag works in JavaScript. At that place, I managed the sound to play right upon the completion of a task by replaying and resetting the audio. Another challenge was making these features work seamlessly, and hence, I tested every addition I made.

What did you learn from this project?
This project has allowed me to further my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage in JavaScript. I also learned how to manage user-friendly interfaces through CSS, including dynamic styling and animations. Furthermore, it helped me understand how important it is to break down a big project into smaller, manageable steps and test it continuously to ensure the features work as intended.

Any feedback or ideas for improvement?
Although this works in an application, I think further work might be done with such points as user accounts, tasks cloud storage, and sharing of tasks between different people. And, of course, drag-and-drop for changing the priority of the tasks and calendar synchronization could bring a plus to the current application. Some feedback in respect of improving the design would be highly appreciated for any further updates.

This project was a very valuable experience that combined creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills. It gave me confidence to tackle larger web development challenges in the future.
